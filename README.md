Tell Me More - a chromium extension to support longdesc

The idea is to make it clear to a user that there are images with longdesc in the page. 
If the right icon comes up, it becomes a button to see what images have longdescs, and link to them,
opening in a new tab.

It's not that great, because I hacked it together one night, but it's meant to show a different UI.
Still, it would be nice to see what happened if it actually worked properlyâ€¦
